                    <h3 class="contentAuthor">By japan guide</h3>
                    <p class="contentText">After World War II had ended, Japan was devastated. All the large cities (with the exception of Kyoto), the industries
                    and the transportation networks were severely damaged. A severe shortage of food continued for several years.
                    <br><br>
                    The occupation of Japan by the Allied Powers started in August 1945 and ended in April 1952. General MacArthur was its
                    first Supreme Commander. The whole operation was mainly carried out by the United States.
                    <br><br>
                    Japan basically lost all the territory acquired after 1894. In addition, the Kurile islands were occupied by the Soviet
                    Union, and the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, were controlled by the USA. Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972,
                    however a territorial dispute with Russia concerning the Kurile Islands has not been resolved yet.
                    <br><br>
                    The remains of Japan's war machine were destroyed, and war crime trials were held. Over 500 military officers committed
                    suicide right after Japan surrendered, and many hundreds more were executed for committing war crimes. Emperor Showa was
                    not declared a war criminal.
                    <br><br>
                    A new constitution went into effect in 1947: The emperor lost all political and military power, and was solely made the
                    symbol of the state. Universal suffrage was introduced and human rights were guaranteed. Japan was also forbidden to
                    ever lead a war again or to maintain an army. Furthermore, Shinto and the state were clearly separated.
                    <br><br>
                    MacArthur also intended to break up power concentrations by dissolving the zaibatsu and other large companies, and by
                    decentralizing the education system and the police. In a land reform, concentrations in land ownership were removed.
                    <br><br>
                    Especially during the first half of the occupation, Japan's media was subject to a rigid censorship of any anti-American
                    statements and controversial topics such as the race issue.
                    <br><br>
                    The co-operation between the Japanese and the Allied powers worked relatively smooth. Critics started to grow when the
                    United States acted increasingly according to her self interests in the Cold War, reintroduced the persecution of
                    communists, stationed more troops in Japan, and wanted Japan to establish an own self defence force despite the anti-war
                    article in the constitution. Many aspects of the occupation's so called "reverse course" were welcomed by conservative
                    Japanese politicians.
                    <br><br>
                    With the peace treaty that went into effect in 1952, the occupation ended. Japan's Self Defence Force was established in
                    1954, accompanied by large public demonstrations. Great public unrest was also caused by the renewal of the US-Japan
                    Security Treaty of 1960.
                    <br><br>
                    After the Korean War, and accelerated by it, the recovery of Japan's economy flourished. The economic growth resulted in
                    a quick rise of the living standards, changes in society and the stabilization of the ruling position of the Liberal
                    Democratic Party (LDP), but also in severe pollution.
                    <br><br>
                    Japan's relations to the Soviet Union were normalized in 1956, the ones to China in 1972.
                    <br><br>
                    The 1973 oil crisis shocked the Japanese economy which was heavily depended on oil. The reaction was a shift to high
                    technology industries.</p>

                        Japan is bounded to the west by the Sea of Japan (East Sea), which separates it from the eastern shores of South and
                        North Korea and southeastern Siberia (Russia)<br><br> to the north by La Perouse (S≈çya) Strait, separating it from Russian-held
                        Sakhalin Island, and by the Sea of Okhotsk<br><br> to the northeast by the southern Kuril Islands (since World War II under

                        Sea, which separates it from China. The island of Tsushima lies between northwestern Kyushu and southeastern South Korea
                        and defines the Korea Strait on the Korean side and the Tsushima Strait on the Japanese side.

                            Just a short ferry ride from mainland Hiroshima is the island of Miyajima, famous the world over as Japan's Shrine
                            Island. Covering an area of 30 square kilometers in Hiroshima Bay, Miyajima is best known as the home of the Itsukushima
                            Shrine, a Shinto temple dedicated to the Princess daughters of the wind god Susanoo.
                            <br><br>
                            Dating from the eighth century, the majority of the shrine's buildings rise out of the waters of a small bay supported
                            only by piles. The effect at high tide is simply stunning, making these structures - including the famous Great Floating
                            Gate (O-Torii) - appear as if they're floating on water.
                            <br><br>
                            Linked together by walkways and bridges, it's a fascinating place to explore, in particular its larger halls. These
                            include the exquisite Honden (Main Hall), the Offerings Hall (Heiden), the Prayer Hall (Haiden), and the Hall of a
                            Thousand Mats (Senjokaku).
                            <br><br>
                            Another notable feature is the shrine's stage, where visitors are entertained with traditional dances and musical
                            performances. Also worth exploring are the island's exquisite grounds and gardens, home to wild deer and numerous bird
                            colonies.
                            <br><br>
                            Please note: You can expect some interruptions and inconvenience from now until 2022 due to major renovations taking
                            place at this historic site.

                            Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) is also the country's highest
                            mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise largely flat landscape to the south and east, this majestic and
                            fabled mountain is tall enough to be seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.
                            <br><br>
                            Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered so important an icon that
                            UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is
                            climbed by more than a million people each summer as an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise from
                            its summit.
                            <br><br>
                            While some still choose to begin their climb from the base, the majority of climbers now start from above the halfway
                            mark, at the 5th Station, resulting in a more manageable six-or-so-hour ascent. Those who do attempt the complete climb
                            are advised to depart in the afternoon, breaking up the climb with an overnight stop at one of the "Mountain Huts"
                            designed for this very purpose. An early start the next day gets you to the top for the sunrise.
                            <br><br>
                            Of course, for many, simply viewing the mountain from the distance, or from the comfort of a speeding train, is enough
                            to say "been there, done that."

                With one of the longest and most complex histories of any country on earth, Japan‚Äôs colors, sights, and traditions have
                fascinated visitors for thousands of years. As a country, it‚Äôs a fascinating look at old-meets-new; Japan holds strong
                to its traditions and roots while still making room for innovation and new trends.
                <br><br>
                Japan is known for everything from onsen hot springs and kabuki baths (dating to the 6th and 16th centuries,
                respectively) to all-night neon-lit dance parties, anime, and sushi boat restaurants, all of which are decidedly more
                modern.
                <br><br>
                In addition to culture, arts, and food, Japan is one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful island chains. Massive mountainscapes
                and lakes dominate the landscape in the inner part of Honshu, the main island, while the coastal areas are dotted with
                beautiful beaches, bamboo forests, and elaborate gardens filled with cherry trees.
                <br><br>
                Use this list of things that Japan is known for to help you build excitement for visiting one of the most culturally
                rich destinations in the world.
