                    <p>Because the Netherlands has no mountain ranges or natural borders, it was not able to protect itself from invading
                    neighbors. Foreigners occupied the country for much of its history.
                    
                    The Romans, Celtic tribes, Germanic groups, Scandinavian Vikings, the Franks, Austrians, and the Spanish ruled parts of
                    the Netherlands for centuries. In the late 1500s, the Dutch tried to overthrow their Spanish rulers. They fought in the
                    Eighty Years’ War and finally gained independence in 1648.
                    
                    During the Napoleonic Wars, France’s Napoleon took over Holland and put his brother Louis on the throne. In 1814, the
                    people claimed independence from France and for 25 years, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands were joined together
                    as one country called the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
                    
                    In 1839, Belgium and the Netherlands became independent and Luxembourg became independent in 1890.
                    
                    During World War II, Germany occupied the Netherlands for five years and killed many people who resisted the Germans or
                    tried to help the Dutch Jews.

                        The Netherlands is a small country sandwiched between Belgium and Germany in Western Europe. The North Sea, located to
                        the north and west of the Netherlands, is continually battering the land.
                        <br><br>
                        The Netherlands is larger than the state of Maryland, but smaller than West Virginia.
                        <br><br>
                        The Dutch have a saying: "God made the Earth, but the Dutch made Holland." The North Sea would have washed away the
                        Netherlands if the Dutch had not erected defenses to protect their land. Over the centuries, the Dutch have built series
                        of canals, dams, dikes, and pumping stations to keep the sea and rivers back.
                        <br><br>
                        Today more than 1,491 miles (2,400 kilometers) of dikes shield the low, flat land—almost half of which lies below sea
                        level—from the North Sea. Without the existing dikes 65 percent of the country would be flooded daily.

                Netherlands, country located in northwestern Europe, also known as Holland. “Netherlands” means low-lying country; the
                name Holland (from Houtland, or “Wooded Land”) was originally given to one of the medieval cores of what later became
                the modern state and is still used for 2 of its 12 provinces (Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland). A parliamentary democracy
                under a constitutional monarch, the kingdom includes its former colonies in the Lesser Antilles: Aruba, Bonaire,
                Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. The capital is Amsterdam and the seat of government The Hague.
                <br><br>
                The country is indeed low-lying and remarkably flat, with large expanses of lakes, rivers, and canals. Some 2,500 square
                miles (6,500 square km) of the Netherlands consist of reclaimed land, the result of a process of careful water
                management dating back to medieval times. Along the coasts, land was reclaimed from the sea, and, in the interior, lakes
                and marshes were drained, especially alongside the many rivers. 
                <br><br>
                All this new land was turned into polders, usually
                surrounded by dikes. Initially, man power and horsepower were used to drain the land, but they were later replaced by
                windmills, such as the mill network at Kinderdijk-Elshout, now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The largest water-control
                schemes were carried out in the second half of the 19th century and in the 20th century, when steam pumps and, later,
                electric or diesel pumps came into use.
