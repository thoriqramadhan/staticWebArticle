                    <h3 class="contentAuthor">By Tim Lambert</h3>
                    <p>An Italian, Giovanni da Verrazano discovered New York Harbor in 1524. In 1609 an Englishman, Henry Hudson, sailed up the
                    Hudson River. Then in 1624, the Dutch founded the first permanent trading post. In 1626 the first governor, Peter
                    Minuit, bought the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans.
                    <br><br>
                    The Dutch built a little town on the southern tip of Manhattan Island. It was called New Amsterdam and it flourished by
                    selling skins. The settlers sold otter, beaver, mink, and seal skins.
                    <br><br>
                    However, New Amsterdam was a tiny town with only about 1,500 inhabitants in the mid-17th century. However, some farmers
                    cultivated the land in Manhattan and in Brooklyn.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, by no means all of the early settlers were Dutch. They included Walloons (from what is now Belgium), French
                    people, and English people. The first Jews arrived in New Amsterdam in 1654.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, the first black slaves arrived in 1628. Slaves played a major role in building the colony.
                    <br><br>
                    In New Amsterdam buildings were, at first, made of wood but in time houses of stone or brick were erected. Thatched
                    roofs were banned in 1657 (because of the risk of fire).
                    <br><br>
                    In 1653 a wall was built across Manhattan Island to protect the little town of New Amsterdam. The street next to it was
                    called Wall Street.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1639 a Swede called Jonas Bronck settled in the Bronx, which is named after him. A settlement was founded at Flushing
                    in 1645.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1658 Dutch farmers built a village they called Nieuw Haarlem (New Harlem) after a town in Holland. In the 18th
                    century, it became a fashionable place for merchants to build country houses. The first settlement on Staten Island was
                    made in 1661.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, in 1647 Peter Stuyvesant (c. 1592-1672) became governor of New Amsterdam. Stuyvesant was the son of a
                    Calvinist minister. He had a wooden leg. In 1647 Stuyvesant wrote ‘I shall govern you as a father his children’.
                    (Remember that fathers were much stricter in the 17th century than they are today). He was as good as his word.
                    Stuyvesant ruled very strictly and he soon alienated the people. Stuyvesant ordered all taverns to close at 9 pm.
                    Nevertheless, in 1653, Stuyvesant established a municipal government for New Amsterdam based on those of Dutch cities.
                    <br><br>
                    However, in 1664 an English fleet arrived. Fearing the English would sack the colony Stuyvesant surrendered. The Dutch
                    briefly recaptured New Amsterdam in 1673 but they lost it to the English again in 1674. This time it was renamed New
                    York in honor of the Duke of York, brother of King Charles II. Meanwhile, Stuyvesant retired to a farm.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1689 a man named Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) staged a coup-d’etat in New York. For his pains, he was executed in 1691.
                    <br><br>
                    Trinity Church was dedicated in 1698.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, in 1635 the Dutch built a fort called Fort Amsterdam. The British later renamed it, Fort George. In 1693 92
                    cannons were installed to protect New York. The area became known as the Battery.</p>

                    <p>New York City is located in the middle of what is known as the BosWash megalopolis, 218 miles (350 km) driving distance
                    from Boston and 232 miles (373 km) from Washington, D.C. The city is situated on the three major islands of Manhattan,
                    Staten Island, and on western Long Island (Brooklyn and Queens), as well as on the mainland in the Bronx. There are also
                    some smaller islands in the surrounding waters, including Ellis Island, Governors Island, Liberty Island, Roosevelt
                    Island, and small islands located in Jamaica Bay.
                    <br><br>
                    The Hudson River flows from the Hudson Valley into New York Bay, becoming a tidal estuary that separates the Bronx and
                    Manhattan from New Jersey. The East River, really a tidal strait, stretches from the Long Island Sound to New York Bay,
                    separating the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson
                    rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx.
                    <br><br>
                    Upper New York Bay is surrounded by Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the coast of New Jersey, and is connected by
                    the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island to Lower New York Bay, which is partially surrounded by Brooklyn, Staten
                    Island, and the coast of New Jersey, and opens to the Atlantic Ocean.
